<h1>CP1406/CP2010 - 2015 - TCMC Project Plan</h1>  
<h2>Group Name</h2>
<p>Team 24</p>

<strong>Members:</strong>
    <p>William Gallagher, Dominic Hin, Darcie Browning, Bradley Pemmelaar, Mitchell Cairney.</p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    
<p>The client wishes for the website to achieve several goals. The client needs the website to recruit new members and increase the engagement of all members in the TCMC's activities. In terms of cencerts, the website aims to increase the number of tickets sold, as well as to encorage potential performers to let the TCMC organise their concerts and engage in promoting their own events (Through photo shoots/ media releases).</p>
    
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
    
<p>The success of the website can be evaluated by noting the number of new members that sign up with the TCMC, as well as the number of concert tickets sold in the three months before the website is upgraded. After the newly upgraded website has been online for 3 months, the number of new memberships sold, and the number of concert tickets purchased should be compared to the three months before the launch of the website upgrade. If the number of new members enrolled and the number of tickets sold is significantly greater in the months after the upgrade, the website has achieved the intended goal.</p>    
    
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
    
<p>The current audience, whom frequently attends concerts held by the TCMC are usually men and women who fall in the age demographic of above 40. These audience members are also very strict on what music types they enjoy and are very resistant to change.</p> 
    
<p>The client wishes to 'specialise in diversity'; thus holding a range of different concert genres. Because current members fall in the above 40 age bracket and are already attending concerts, in order to sell more tickets and sign-up new members, the website will be aimed at a younger age demographic. In particular the website will aim for people between the ages of 20 and 35. This new audience will enjoy a range of music genre and are perhaps less decided on one specific genre or concert type that they enjoy. </p>
    
<p>Aiming at a younger target audience hopes to attract a number of new members that will volunteer in their spare time to assist with concert preparations, as well as to ensure that the TCMC sticks around for generations of music lovers to come.</p>
