<h1>CP1406/CP2010 - 2015 - TCMC Project Plan</h1>  
<h2>Group Name</h2>
<p>Team 24</p>

<strong>Members:</strong>
"William Gallagher, Dominic Hin, Darcie Browning, Bradley Pemmelaar, Mitchell Cairney"

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p> The main goal of the website is to attract new members and volunteers. As well as to get these new and current members to engage more in events, concerts and activities held by the TCMC.</p>
    
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of the Website can be evaluated by noting how many new sign-ups the center has in the three months before the website is upgraded. After newly created website has been online for 3 months, the number of member sign-ups should be compared to the three months before the website was launched. If the number of sign-ups in the 3 months is significantly greater, the website has achieved the intended goal.</p>
    
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The current audience that frequently attends concerts with TCMC are usually in the age demographic of above 40. The current audience are also very strict on what music types they enjoy. In order to widen the target audience and attract more members; the website is to be aimed at younger generations. This will shift the target demographic to people whom may attend concerts more regularly, thus boosting ticket sales. As well as ensure that the TCMC stays alive for generations to come.
