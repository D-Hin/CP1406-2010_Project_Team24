    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    
 <p>The client wants to use the website to recruit new members, and increase engagement of members through volunteer work. The website also aims to sell more tickets to concerts held by the TCMC and to increase the number of performers that sign up to perform a concert with the TCMC.</p>
    
    <h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Darcie Browning:</strong> Did plan.html and report.html, completed HTML content for basic pages and CSS, image slider for homepage, responsible for responsiveness of pages to resizing.</li>
        <li><strong>Bradley Pammelaar:</strong> HTML and CSS for secondary pages, such as performer signup, volunteer signup, member signup, added the map to the about page, initial styling of navigation images for M1. </li>
        <li><strong>William Gallagher: </strong> Database work, adding and deleting artists, events and bulletins as well as user accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Dominic Hin: </strong> Assisted Will with creating the database, as well as writing the code needed to connect said database to the rest of the site. Presented the site on behalf of the group.</li>

    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> The two subjects worked well together in terms of both being responsible for different aspects of the website project.</p> <p>Being marked individually for your subjects work was a great idea, and took pressure off of groups that didn't have equal member contribution for both subjects.</p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> At stages it was unclear which subject was responsible for what, an example of this was the form layout and JS error checking. The CP1406 students did the layouts of the forms, but were a little unsure of what the CP2010 students needed, and who was responsible for error checking using JS.</p>
    <p>In groups where there was not equal contribution of all members, there was then a lot expected of one or two members.</p>
    <p>One of the CP2010 students was away sick due to illness for a majority of the project, and one of the CP1406 students did not contribute to the group, adding stress and more work for contributing members.</p>
    <p>In some cases we didn't know how our two milestones fitted together, and who was responsible for making them work together.e.g. forms, artist pages.</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> Most of the group communicated well and turned up to meetings on a regular basis. However, it was a litte tricky to communicate well with students from the other subject, as we often didn't have a clear idea of what they were working on and how things were all coming together for that subjects milestone.</p>
